# iqbal-photography

A website for a client who is a freelance photographer. 
Website is live at 'http://iqbalphotographynyc.com/'.

This site was made with a mobile-first approach which makes it very responsive to different screen sizes.

I used HTML, CSS and Javascript as my core languages for this project. 
I integrated CSS animations and an HTML form into this project.
I wrote in some HTML using javascript to make it easier for changes and editing in the future.
